    In a nutshell

        <p>
        Hello! I am a PhD candidate (awaiting convocation) in Industrial Engineering from the University of Toronto. During my PhD I have worked in the Medical Operations Research Lab (<a class="current" href="https://morlab.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">morLAB</a>) with advisors <a class="current" href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/aleman/" target="_blank">Dionne Aleman</a> and <a class="current" href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/bodur/" target="_blank">Merve Bodur</a>.

        My research has focused on the application of operations research to barter exchanges in healthcare systems such as kidney paired donation, also known as kidney exchange. This research includes using large-scale optimization methods (e.g., branch-and-price), graph theory, and machine learning to improve transplant outcomes for real-world settings in kidney exchange, which include managing uncertainty and the design of policies to repair planned decisions that fall through. While the case study of my research has focused on healthcare, the methodologies I have used can be translated to other domains, such as vehicle routing, scheduling, among others.
