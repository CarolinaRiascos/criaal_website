  abstract: Kidney paired donation programs allow patients registered with an incompatible donor to receive a suitable kidney from another donor, as long as the latter's co-registered patient, if any, also receives a kidney from a different donor. The kidney exchange problem (KEP) aims to find an optimal collection of kidney exchanges taking the form of cycles and chains. Existing exact solution methods for KEP either are designed for the case where only cyclic exchanges are considered, or can handle long chains but are scalable as long as cycles are short. We develop the first decomposition method that is able to deal with long cycles and long chains for large realistic instances. More specifically, we propose a branch-and-price framework, in which the pricing problems are solved (for the first time in packing problems in a digraph) through multi-valued decision diagrams. Also, we present a new upper bound on the optimal value of KEP, stronger than the one proposed in the literature, which is obtained via our master problem. Computational experiments show superior performance of our method over the state of the art by optimally solving almost all instances in the PrefLib library for multiple cycle and chain lengths.

  abstract: Kidney paired donation programs (KPDPs) match patients with willing but incompatible donors to compatible donors with an assurance that when they donate, their intended recipient receives a kidney in return from a different donor. A patient and donor join a KPDP as a pair, represented as a vertex in a compatibility graph, where arcs represent compatible kidneys flowing from a donor in one pair to a patient in another. A challenge faced in real-world KPDPs is the possibility of a planned match being cancelled, e.g., due to late detection of organ incompatibility or patient-donor dropout. We therefore develop a two-stage robust optimization approach to the kidney exchange problem wherein (1) the first stage determines a kidney matching solution according to the original compatibility graph, and then (2) the second stage repairs the solution after observing transplant cancellations. In addition to considering homogeneous failure, we present the first approach that considers non-homogeneous failure between vertices and arcs. To this end, we develop solution algorithms with a feasibility-seeking master problem and evaluate two types of recourse policies. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art kidney exchange algorithm under homogeneous failure on publicly available instances. Moreover, we provide insights on the scalability of our solution algorithms under non-homogeneous failure for two recourse policies and analyze their impact on highly-sensitized patients, patients for whom few kidney donors are available and whose associated exchanges tend to fail at a higher rate than non-sensitized patients.
- paper: Planning for the Worst-Case Transplant Cancellations in Kidney Exchange
  state: Work in progress
  abstract: A kidney paired donation (KPD) program gathers pairs of patients in need of a kidney along with their incompatible donors, and non-directed donors (NDDs), who donate without having an associated patient expecting a transplant. Patients obtain a compatible kidney by exchanging their paired donors in such a way that transplants are arranged via cycles as well as chains triggered by NDDs. We provide a simulation to assess the performance of our previous deterministic and robust kidney exchange optimization frameworks over time. The decision maker can then decide whether or not to repair the planned set of transplants after inspecting it for failures (e.g., a positive physical crossmatch). Similar to the Canadian KPD program and others in the world, our simulation does not use bridge donors, i.e., it assumes that the donor in the last pair can donate to a patient in the waitlist and hence this donor is no longer considered for future chains in the simulation. The goal of our analysis is to provide insight on questions such as how frequently should patients and donors be matched?; is the robust approach too conservative in terms of the number of patients matched?; and are there conditions for which the robust approach is preferred over the deterministic approach, or vice versa?. Over a two-year simulation, we ultimately find that a deterministic+repair approach can lead to slightly more matches than a robust scheme when repairs can be performed before the next matching, otherwise, a robust scheme with short cycles and chains is generally preferred, particularly when the time between matchings is long or arrivals to the KPD pool are frequent.
