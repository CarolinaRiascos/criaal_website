        Navigating large-scale decision making: Leveraging optimization models for policy making
        <p class='sub-heading'>
        I am interested in designing modelling frameworks and algorithms that can reliably provide an optimal design and policy evaluation, despite a system's high complexity

            Large as a vehicle system with thousands (possibly millions) of pick-up and drop-off points or large as a centralized registry with several hundreds of patients with end-stage renal disease awaiting for a living-donor transplant. A system can be large depending on the goals we set for it and the conditions that make our system what it is. Typically, the more conditions the larger our system becomes in terms of the set of decisions we can make, among which we refer to some as <i>optimal</i>. Identifying an optimal decision is not trivial when our system is large; doing so while modelling policies makes decision making quite complex and may limit our ability to investigate the implications of the policies we design. If we can deal with the complexity surrounding our system, we can provide reasonable evidence of its current state and its evolution under what-if scenarios.

            Designing modelling frameworks and algorithms that can reliably and efficiently provide an optimal design and policy evaluation, despite high complexity, is an important goal of mine. I make use of operations research and machine learning as powerhouses to improve decision-making in large and complex systems.
